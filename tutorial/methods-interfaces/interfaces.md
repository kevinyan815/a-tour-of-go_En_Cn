# Interfaces

> An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures.

一个接口类型被定义为一系列方法签名的集合。

> A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.

一个接口类型的变量可以保存任何实现了这些方法的值。

> Note: There is an error in the example code on line 22. Vertex (the value type) doesn't implement Abser because the Abs method is defined only on *Vertex (the pointer type).
